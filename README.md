# ReactJS Widgets

The goal of this project is to familiarized myself even more with builing reusable React code modules using hooks.

## Widgets built:

- Accordion: expading content onClick, show only one active panel
- Search page: search using Wikipedia's API, show a list of content
- Downdown: A downdown list with different options
- Translate: Translate a piece of text to a different language

## Library used:

Semantic UI: [semantic-ui.com](https://semantic-ui.com)

## React hooks used:

- useState( )
- useEffect( )
- useRef( )

## Issue went through:

- useEffect tricky warning
- child -> parent prop passing
- event bubbling (React events & regular DOM events)
- the 'capture' phrase in React 17
- toggle a panel outside of its component
